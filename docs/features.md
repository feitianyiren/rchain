#### A successful genesis ceremony 
##### test: test/test_genesis_ceremony.py::test_successful_genesis_ceremony 
##### steps:

* `ceremonyMaster` is instatantied with flags `--required-sigs 2 --duration 5min --interval 10sec --bonds-file <holds two nodes validatorA and validatorB`.
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` joins p2p, both pointing to `ceremonyMaster` as bootstrap

* `validatorA` and `validatorB` receives `UnapprovedBlock`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` send back `BlockApproval`
* `ceremonyMaster` transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler`
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `ApprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` transition to ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler
* `ceremonyMaster`, `validatorA` and `validatorB` tip points to block (genesis) where it has no parent and Bonds holds `validatorA` and `validatorB`

##### test: not available 
##### steps: TBD
### As a wallet dApp developer, I want to use Ethereum-style addresses for send transactions to specify the recipient, so that a) I can reuse available Ethereum utility libraries; b) so the QR code is smaller and thus faster to scan than it would be for a full public key; c) it is easier for users to verbally confirm their address versus public key; and d) so RChain is more palatable for the Ethereum community
##### test: not available 
##### steps: TBD
